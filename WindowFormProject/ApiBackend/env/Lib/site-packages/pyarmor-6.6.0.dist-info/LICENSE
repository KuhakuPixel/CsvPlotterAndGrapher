     END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

     The following agreement regarding PyArmor - referred to as "software" - is
     made between Jondy Zhao - referred to as "licensor" - and anyone who is
     installing, accessing or in any other way using the software - referred to
     as "user".

  1. The author and holder of the copyright of the software is Jondy Zhao.

  2. The software is distributed as Free To Use But Restricted:

     a. The maximum size of code object is about 32768 bytes in trial version

     b. The scripts obfuscated by trial version are not private. It
        means anyone could generate the license file which works for
        these obfuscated scripts.

     c. Without permission the trial version may not be used for the Python
        scripts of any commercial product.

     d. In trial version the module could not be obfuscated by advanced mode if
        there are more than about 30 functions (code objects) in this module.

  3. There are 2 basic types of licenses issued for the software. These are:

     a. A personal license for home users. The user purchases one license to use
        the software on his own computer.

        Home users may use their personal license to obfuscate all the python
        scripts which are property of the license owner, to generate private
        license files for the obfuscated scripts and distribute them and all the
        required files to any other machine or device.

        Home users could NOT obfuscate any python script which is NOT property
        of the license owner.

     b. A enterprise license for business users. The user purchases one license
        to use the software for one product serials of an organization.

        One product serials include the current version and any other latter
        versions of the same product.

        Business users may use their enterprise license on all computers and
        embedded devices to obfuscate all the python scripts of this product
        serials, to generate private license files for these obfuscated scripts
        and distribute them and all the required files to any other machine and
        device.

        Without permission of "licensor" the license purchased for one product
        serials should not be used for other product serials. Business users
        should purchase new license for different product serials.

     A user who purchased a license, is granted a non-exclusive right to use
     the software on as many computers as defined by the licensing terms above
     according to the number of licenses purchased, for any legal purpose.

     In any case, the software is only used to obfuscate the Python scripts
     owned by the authorized person or enterprise. For example, if PyCharm
     purchases one license, it's no problem to obufscate any Python script
     of PyCharm self, but it's not allowed to apply this license to the Python
     scripts just written in the PyCharm by someone else.

  4. There are no additional license fees, apart from the cost of the license,
     associated with the creation and distribution of obfuscated python scripts.
     Owners of a license may use their copies of the software to produce
     obfuscated python scripts and to distribute those files free of any
     additional royalties.

  5. To buy a license, please run command

         pyarmor register --buy

     Or open the following url in any web browser

         https://order.shareit.com/cart/add?vendorid=200089125&PRODUCT[300871197]=1

     A registration file generally named "pyarmor-regcode-1.txt" will be sent by
     email immediately after payment is completed successfully.

     Save it to disk, then run the following command to register PyArmor

         pyarmor register /path/to/pyarmor-regcode-1.txt

     Check the registration information:

         pyarmor register

     After registration successfully, remove all the obfuscated scripts by trial
     version, then obfuscate them again.

     The registration code is valid forever, it can be used permanently. But it
     may not be rented or leased.

        permission.

        for the download or making the download conditional on the user giving
        his contact data.

     c. The unmodified installation file of PyArmor must be provided pure and
        unpaired. Any bundling is interdicted. In particular the use of any
